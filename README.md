### Hello Everybody and thanks for visiting! ðŸ‘‹



  ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on expanding my web development skills and dive more into Python and the software world!
   
  ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on web projects & concept, develop & build a new art collective.
  
  ðŸ’¬ Ask me about art, gaming, music those are my biggest passions in life.

  âš¡ Fun fact: I'm not brand new to the web space or technology my day time job for 10 years was warehouse automation and robotics!


For 15+ Years I've been creating forums around Gaming, Art and been on social media back when it was just text chats and MMOs keeping us connected. I'm pretty reserved any anti-social but once you get to know me chances are we got tons in common.
