**lmaogb/lmaogb** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

  ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on expanding my web development skills and dive more into Python and the software world!
  ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on web projects & develop a new art collective.
  ğŸ’¬ Ask me about art, gaming, music!

  âš¡ Fun fact: I'm not brand new to the web space or technology my day time job for 10 years was warehouse automation and robotics!
